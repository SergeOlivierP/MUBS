# MUBS

- Generating mutually unbiased basis sets of quantum states for 2,4 and 8 qubits (dimension 4,16 and 256 respectively) using different techniques.
- Uniform sampling of maximally decorrelated states for general statistical tests: 
    - Entropy approximation, 
    - Optimal detection probability
    - Square root measurement detecion probability
    - Maximum eigenvalues for min-entropy uncertainty relations
